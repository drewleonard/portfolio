                I am a junior at Dartmouth College studying Government and Computer Science, and am interested in international relations topics such as foreign policy and international security. Domestic politics interest me also, as shifts in political leadership and ideologies have called into question international institutions underpinning norms and security.

            <div class="about-content">
                I hope to leverage computer science tools to analyze and inform audiences about salient international and domestic political issues. While political science and computer science share many intersections, data-driven journalism is particularly important in providing objective and engaging reporting during times of political instability.

                My interests in international relations took on their academic dimension during an internship at the Council on Foreign Relations (Summer 2017), when I learned about the origins of the United States' foreign policy. Since then, I have had the opportunity to engage international relations topics at Dartmouth through coursework and research.

                Currently, I am in London, England studying at the London School of Economics and Political Science. I spend most of each year at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH. I split my remaining time between Washington, D.C. and Tampa, FL.
